# A project that helps teachers create exams

An exam creation tool for teachers made with React. It is meant to ease the creation of printable exams. It is only meant for printable exams and not electronic ones. The visual look of the app isn't that fancy as it was created for a specific need of an acquaintance of mine. All the additional buttons and such are hidden when printing.

Need features and visual upgrades are planned. The app has many good features but is missing some still.

The app is fully made in React.
